Problem 2 is a multi-step problem. 

Running it gives you a hint:
As a rule, men worry more about what they can't see than about what they can.

This is a Julius Ceaser quote. From this, you might guess a caeser cypher will be involved.
There is also a number spit out of 3. This could be the cypher key.

A strings on the compiled file will show this:
As a rulH
e, men wH
orry morH
e about H
what theH
y can't H
see thanH
 about wH
hat theyH
 canf
flag{rzqH
 wkh qhwH


From what is put out to the screen, you can guess this is the encrypted flag:
flag{rzqv wkh qhw}

From this info, you could decypher the flag with the key of three:

flag{own the net}

Alternately if someone threw this into gdb, with the right breakpoints, you could see values for flag and key. 
The key is actually 315, but due to keeping the key as letters, you mod it by 26. This gives you the key of 3.
Also if you ran it long enough, you might even catch the decrypted flag.
