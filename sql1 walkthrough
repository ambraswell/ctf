sql1 walkthrough:
service mysql start
mysql -u root -p 
create database test;
ctrl+d
mysql -u root -p test < sql1.sql
mysql -u root -p test
desc test.tbl_flag;
select * from tbl_flag where is_flag = 1;

The flag is Little Bobby Tables

I didn't want to put flag{} around it to keep it from being grepable.
